## Context Free Grammars

A __context-free grammar (CFG)__ is a 4-tuple $(V,\Sigma,R,S)$ where:
* $V$ is a finite set called __variables__ (or: __non-terminals__).
* $\Sigma$ is a finite set, disjoint from $V$, called __terminals__.
* $R$ is a finite set of __rules__.  Each rule is a pair of a variable $A$ and a string $u$ of variables and terminals which we together write as $A \to u$.
* $S \in V$ is the __start variable__.

We will typically use $G,H$ and so on to refer to generic grammars.

### Language Generated

Suppose $u$, $v$ and $w$ are strings of variables and terminals. 

If $A \to w$ is a rule of the grammar, we say that $uAv$ __yields__ $uwv$ and write $uAv \Rightarrow uwv$.  We say that $u$ __derives__ $v$ and write $u \overset{*}{\Rightarrow} v$ just if there is a sequence $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_k$ ($k \geq 1$) and:
* $u = u_1$
* $u_1 \Rightarrow u_2 \Rightarrow \cdots{} \Rightarrow u_k$
* $v = u_k$

The __language__ generated by the grammar $(V,\,\Sigma,R,S)$ is $$\{w \in \Sigma^* \mid S \overset{*}{\Rightarrow} w \}$$.
